# UC Berkeley CS61C:  Great Ideas in Computer Architecture - [UC Berkeley CS 61C Great Ideas in Computer Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhMnuBfGeCDM8pXLpqib90mDFJI-e1lpk)


### Lecture 1 - Intro
6 Great ideas in computer architecture:
1) Abstration(Layers of representation/interpretation):
    - Logic gates
    - ALU(e.g. Adder wth logic gates)
    - Machine language
    - Assembly language
    - High level language
2) Moore's Law(Designing through trends): Predicts 2X transistors / chip every 2 years
3) Principle of locality(Memory hierarchy): How far away is the data?
4) Parallelism
5) Performance measurement & improvement
6) Dependability via redundancy: Redundancy so that a failing piece doesn't make the whole system fail

Inside computers, everything is a number.
