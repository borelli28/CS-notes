Program: A sequence of instructions that must be executeed for the application to function as intended. When a program is launched it becomes a process.

Process: A program in execution.
	- Each process has an eprocess. An eprocess contains information about the process like; creation time, id, parent process id, and kprocess whichs is informatio abotu the kernel.

Thread: A unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads that execute concurrently for better performance.

Service: A program that performs a specific task. Services run in the background and they don't have GUIs.

Access control lists: Defines read/write/execute permissions.

Drivers: Program that helps OS interact with a hardware device.

Virtual memory: A mapping of all the memory pages of an application in physical memory, each application has their own virtual memory.
	Windows API that manage virtual memory:
		- VirtualAllocEx
		- VirtualProtectEx
		- VirtualLock
		- VirtualUnlock
		- VirtualQuery

Jobs: A set of processes as a group. For each process, the job object defines parameters like process priority, CPU time, network use, disk use, etc.

Objects and handles: A system resource that is used by an application in execution. A handle is a reference to a windows object.

Registry: A database that contains configuration information for the OS, users, and application installed in the system.
	- HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT: Holds information about all possible file extensions and the applications that can be used to open them.
	- HKEY_CURRENT_USER: Holds information about the current logged user in the system.
	- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE: Holds important system configuration information. Data requried at boot time is present withing this key directory. 
	- HKEY_USER: Contains account specific preferences and configuration, for each user account on the system.
	- HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG: Is a shortcut to the data within the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key.

Access Token: Security information for process/thread.
	Privileges:
		- SeLoadDriverPrivilege: A process can load and unload kernel-level drivers.
		- SeMachineAccountPrivilege: A process can create new user accounts on a system.
		- SeShutDownPrivilege: A process can initiate a system reboot.

Remote procedure call: Communication mechanism used often on windows systems on the background. It can be used by processes and services to communicate locally, and can also be used by remote computers to communicate with each other.
	RPC DLLs:
		- rpcrt4,dll: Contains important function to establish RPC connection, and processing exchanged data.
		- rpcns4.dll: Assist with the resolution of system names to network addresses.
		- rpcproxy.dll: Used to tunnel RPC traffic over HTTP.
