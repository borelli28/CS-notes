Practical Malware Analysis - Book Notes


What is malware analysis?
	Dissecting malware to understand how it works, how to identify it, and how to defeat or eliminate it.

Goal of malware analysis:
	Determine exactly what a suspect binary can do, how to detect it on the network, and how to measure and contain its damage.

	- Host based signatures: Used to detect malware on hosts.
	- Network signatures: Used to detect malware by monitoring network traffic.

Malware analysis techniques
	- Basic static analysis: Examining the executable file without viewing the actual instructions.
	- Basic dynamic analysis: Running the malware and observing its behavior to remove the infection and/or produce effective signatures.
	- Advanced static analysis: Reverse engineering malware internals by loading the executable into a disassembler and looking at the program instructions.
	- Advanced dynamic analysis: Use a debugger to examine the internal statis of a running malicious executable.
