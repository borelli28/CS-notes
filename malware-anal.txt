Practical Malware Analysis - Book Notes


What is malware analysis?
	Dissecting malware to understand how it works, how to identify it, and how to defeat or eliminate it.

Goal of malware analysis:
	Determine exactly what a suspect binary can do, how to detect it on the network, and how to measure and contain its damage.

	- Host based signatures: Used to detect malware on hosts.
	- Network signatures: Used to detect malware by monitoring network traffic.

Malware analysis techniques
	- Basic static analysis: Examining the executable file without viewing the actual instructions.
	- Basic dynamic analysis: Running the malware and observing its behavior to remove the infection and/or produce effective signatures.
	- Advanced static analysis: Reverse engineering malware internals by loading the executable into a disassembler and looking at the program instructions.
	- Advanced dynamic analysis: Use a debugger to examine the internal statis of a running malicious executable.

Types of malware
	- Backdoor: Malicious code that allow attacker access to the system.
	- Botnet: Computers infected by malware that allows attacker to control system from a C2 server.
	- Downloader: Malicious code that downloads other malicious code. Usually used when attacker first gain access to the system(exploitation).
	- Information-stealing malware: Collects information of victim computer and sends it to attacker.
	- Launcher: Malicious program that launches other malicious program.
	- Rootkit: Malicious code designed to hide the conceal the exisitence of the attacker on the system.
	- Worm or virus: Malicious code that copy itself and infect addtional computers in the enviroment.
