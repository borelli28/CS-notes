PROFESSOR MESSER SECURITY+ COURSE


Phishing: 
	- Typosquatting: Use typos to mimic the legit URL or prepend a character somewhere in the hopes that the victim does not notice.

	- Pretexting: Lying to get information.
	
	- Pharming: When attackers take over a legit website to harvest from a large group of users.
	
	- Vishing: Phishing over the phone.
	
Dumpster diving:
	- Gather information from the trash
	
Watering hole attacks:
	- Attackers instead of attacking an organization systems, will find a target where individuals from that organizations visit or use. For example, sandwich shop restaurant app get's hacked and every individual from that organization that orders from the app gets infected.
	
Malware:
	- Malware is malicious software.
	
	- Viruses: Malware that reproduce itself with user interaction with the malware.
		- Fileless viruses: A stealth attack virus where no file is stored on the victim computer, the malware is stored in RAM. For example; User clicks on a link on an email, website exploits flash, java, windows vulnerability, launches and downloads payload in RAM, run powershell scripts and execute attacks on objective, add an auto-start to Registry for persistence.
	
	- Worms: Malware that self replicates but does not need user interaction. Typically uses network transmissions.
	
	- Ransomware: Encrypts data.
	
	- Trojans: Software that pretends to be a legit software app.
		- RAT(remote access trojans): Remote administration tool that gives the attacker control of the device.
		
	- Rootkit: Modifies core system files, part of the kernel.
		- Secure boot(UEFI): It will check the BIOS for any changes, if it detects a change it will not boot the BIOS.
		
Physical attacks:
	- Malicious USB cable: Looks like a normal USB but tells the OS that is a HID(human interface device), and then may start writing commands to download malware.
	
	- Malicious flash drive: may include malicious files or may act as a HID and type command to download malware. It may also act as a WAP to allow other devices to gain access to your internal network.
		
Cryptographic attacks:
	- Birthday attacks: Hash collisions, because two different values hash to the same hash.
	
	- Downgrade attacks: Force systems to downgrade their security by using a weaker encryption algorithm.
	
Privilege escalation: A vulnerability is exploited in the system to gain a higher level access to the system.

Cross site scripting(XSS): Information from one site could be shared with another.
	- Reflected: Web site allows scripts to run in user input. The attacker emails a link that runs a script that sends credentials/session/cookies to the attacker.
	- Stored: Attacker posts a message to a social network with a malicious payload. It is now persistent everyone gets the payload.
		
Code injection: When attacker adds their own information into a data stream.
		- SQL injection: Attacker modifies queries.
		- XML injection: Attacker modifies requests.
		- DLL injection: A windows library containing code and data. It involves inserting or injecting a DLL file into the address space of a running process, this way the DLL gets executed by the process.
		
Replay attack: Attacker gather raw network data and use the information to mimic a legit system in the network.
	- Pass the hash: Attacker captures the hash of a user password during traffic, then it send packets in the network using this hash to authenticate itself.
	
	Encryption(TLS) prevents replays attacks by encrypting the network traffic.
		
Cross site request forgery(CSRF): Takes advantage of the user browser sessions. The attacker may sent a hyperlink with a post request to a website the user is logged in, there for the request is initiated by the user but without their authorization.
		
Race condition: Two conditions execute at the same time, which can causes unintended outputs. Developers can mitigate this by consider every possible scenario and developing the software based on this knowledge.

Other app attacks
	Memory vulnerabilities
		- Memory leak: Unused memory is not properly released and it begins to slowly grow in size until system crashes.
		- Null pointer dereference: Attacker change the pointer to refer to nothing and the application crash and debug information is displayed.
		- Integer overflow: Attacker adds a larger number than it's expected causing a buffer overflow.
	
	Directory traversal: Attacker is able to read files from a web server that are outside of the website file directory by traversing(../../..).	
	
	Resource exhaustion
		- API attacks: Can expose sensitive data, DoS, intercepted communications, privileged access.
		- ZIP bomb: 42KB file that when unzip will uncompressed to 4.5 petabytes.
		- DHCP starvation: Attacker floods a network with IP address requests and DHCP runs out of addresses.
		
Rogue access point: Unauthorized wireless access point that may be used as a backdoor. By using 802.1X(Network access control) you can mitigate this attack by requiring authentication to the network.
		
Bluejacking: Attacker sends unsolicited messages to another device via Bluetooth.
	Bluesnarfing: Attacker access a bluetooth-enabled device and transfer data. This vulnerability was patched on 2003.
	
Wireless disassocitation attacks: Attacker deauthenticate a wireless access point to cause a DoS attack.

Wireless jamming
	Different types:
		- Constant random bits/constant legitimate frames.
		- Data sent at random times - random data and legitimate frames
		- Reactive jamming: Jamming only occurs when somebody tries to communicate through the frequency.
	
	Radio frequency(RF) jamming: DoS attack that prevents wireless communications. It works by transmitting interfering wireless signals to decrease the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiving device, for which the receiving device cannot hear the good signal.
		
RFID and NFC attacks
	RFID(Radio frequency identification): Works with a tag that transmit an ID when it receives a radio energy.
		Attacks:
			- Data capture: Attacker can view communications and or do a replay attack.
			- Spoof the reader: Attacker write their own data into the tag.
			- DoS: Signal jamming.
			- Decrypt communication: Many default keys are on Google.
			
	NFC(Near field communication): Two way wireless communication that builds on RFID, which is one way.
		Attacks:
			- Remote capture: Attacker may be able to capture information if he is within 10 meters of the active device.
			- Frequency jamming: Attacker may jammed the communication and cause a DoS.
			- Relay/Replay attack
			- Loss of RFC device control: If the device is lost of stolen.
