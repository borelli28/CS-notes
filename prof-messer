PROFESSOR MESSER SECURITY+ COURSE


Phishing: 
	- Typosquatting: Use typos to mimic the legit URL or prepend a character somewhere in the hopes that the victim does not notice.

	- Pretexting: Lying to get information.
	
	- Pharming: When attackers take over a legit website to harvest from a large group of users.
	
	- Vishing: Phishing over the phone.
	
Dumpster diving:
	- Gather information from the trash
	
Watering hole attacks:
	- Attackers instead of attacking an organization systems, will find a target where individuals from that organizations visit or use. For example, sandwich shop restaurant app get's hacked and every individual from that organization that orders from the app gets infected.
	
Malware:
	- Malware is malicious software.
	
	- Viruses: Malware that reproduce itself with user interaction with the malware.
		- Fileless viruses: A stealth attack virus where no file is stored on the victim computer, the malware is stored in RAM. For example; User clicks on a link on an email, website exploits flash, java, windows vulnerability, launches and downloads payload in RAM, run powershell scripts and execute attacks on objective, add an auto-start to Registry for persistence.
	
	- Worms: Malware that self replicates but does not need user interaction. Typically uses network transmissions.
	
	- Ransomware: Encrypts data.
	
	- Trojans: Software that pretends to be a legit software app.
		- RAT(remote access trojans): Remote administration tool that gives the attacker control of the device.
		
	- Rootkit: Modifies core system files, part of the kernel.
		- Secure boot(UEFI): It will check the BIOS for any changes, if it detects a change it will not boot the BIOS.
		
Physical attacks:
	- Malicious USB cable: Looks like a normal USB but tells the OS that is a HID(human interface device), and then may start writing commands to download malware.
	
	- Malicious flash drive: may include malicious files or may act as a HID and type command to download malware. It may also act as a WAP to allow other devices to gain access to your internal network.
		
Cryptographic attacks:
	- Birthday attacks: Hash collisions, because two different values hash to the same hash.
	
	- Downgrade attacks: Force systems to downgrade their security by using a weaker encryption algorithm.
	
Privilege escalation: A vulnerability is exploited in the system to gain a higher level access to the system.

Cross site scripting(XSS): Information from one site could be shared with another.
	- Reflected: Web site allows scripts to run in user input. The attacker emails a link that runs a script that sends credentials/session/cookies to the attacker.
	- Stored: Attacker posts a message to a social network with a malicious payload. It is now persistent everyone gets the payload.
