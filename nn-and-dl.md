### Perceptrons
A perceptron is a type of artifical neural network develop in the 1950s and 60s by scientist Frank Rosenblatt.

A perceptron takes several binary inputs, x1, x2, x3, and produces a single binary output:

In order to compute the output, we use weights, which are real numbers that tell us how important each input is. The neuron's output, 0 or 1, is determined by whether the weighted sum is less than or greater than some threshold value.
