# Big O - Time Complexity


Big O is a metric for determining the efficiency of an algorithm. It is a way to describe how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size grows.

#### O(1) - Constant Time
Has the least complexity. The runtime of the algorithm does not change with the input size.

#### O(log n) - Logarithmic Time
The input size decreases by a constant factor with each iteration. Binary search is an example of an algorithm with logarithmic time complexity.

#### O(n) - Linear Time
Algorithm runtime grows linearly with the size of the input.

#### O(n^2) - Quadratic Time
The best example of this algorithm complexity is a nested loop. The runtime of the algorithm grows quadratically with the input size.

#### O(2^n) - Exponential Time
The growth rate doubles with each addition to the input size.
