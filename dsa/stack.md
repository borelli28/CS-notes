# Stacks


A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out(FILO). Its an abstract data type with two main operations; push and pop.

#### Push
Adds an element to the top of the stack. If the stack is full, then its called an overflow condition, which can be prevented by implementing an isFull function.

#### Pop
Removes an element from the top of the stack. If the stack is empty, then its called underflow condition, which can be prevented by implementing an isEmpty function.
