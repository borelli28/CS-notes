NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK 2.0


The CSF outlines specific outcomes that organizations can achieve to address risk.

- Govern:
    The organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored.
    
    - Understand and assess specific cybersecurity needs: Determine your organization's unique risks and needs.
    
    - Develop a tailored cybersecurity risk strategy: This should be based on your organization's specific cybersecurity objectives, the risk environment, and lessons learned from the past.
    
    - Establish defined risk management policies: Policies should be approved by management and should be organization-wide, repeatable, and recurring, and should align with the current cybersecurity threat environment, risks, and mission objectives.
    
    - Develop and communicate organizational cybersecurity practices: These must be straightforward and communicated regularly.
    
    - Establish and monitor cybersecurity supply chain risk management: Establish strategy, policy, and roles and responsibilities; including for overseeing suppliers, customers, and partners.
    
    - Implement continuous oversight and checkpoints: Analyze risks at regular intervals and monitor them continuously.

Identify:
	The organization's current cybersecurity risks are understood.
	
	- Asset management: Assets(data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people, etc.) are identified and managed.

	- Risk assessment: The cybersecurity risks to the organization, assets, and individuals are understood by the organization.
	
	- Improvement: Improvements to organizational cybersecurity risk management processes, procedures, and activities are identified across all CSF functions. 

Protect:
	Safeguards are implemented to manage the organization cybersecurity risks.
	
	- Identity management, authentication, and access control: Access to physical and logical assets is limited to authorized users, services, and hardware.

	- Awareness and training: The organization personnel are provided with cybersecurity awareness and training so that they can perform thir cybersecurity related tasks.

	- Data security: Data is managed consistent with organization risk strategy to protect the CIA of the information.
	
	- Platform security: The hardware, software, and services are managed consistent with the organization risk strategy to protect their CIA.

	- Technology infrastructure resilience: Security architechtures are managed consistent with the organization risk strategy to protect their CIA.
	
Detect:
	Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed.
	
	- Continous monitoring: Assets are monitored to find potentially adverse events.

	- Adverse events analysis; Anomalies, IOCs, and other adverse events are analyzed to characterize the events and detect cybersecurity incidents. 


Respond:
	Actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken.

	- Incident management: Response to cybersecurity incident are managed.

	- Incident analysis: Investigations are conducted to ensure effective response and support forensics and recovery activities.

	- Incident response reporting and communication: Response activities are coordinated with internal and external stakeholders as required by laws, regulations, or policies.

	- Incident mitigation: Activities are performed to prevent expansion of an event and mitigate its effect.

Recover:
	Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored.

	- Incident recovery plan execution: Restoration activities are performed to ensure operational availability of system and services affected by the cybersecurity incident are restored.

	- Incident recovery communication: Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties.
