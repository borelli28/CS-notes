NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK 2.0


The CSF outlines specific outcomes that organizations can achieve to address risk.

- Govern:
    The organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored.
    
    - Understand and assess specific cybersecurity needs: Determine your organization's unique risks and needs.
    
    - Develop a tailored cybersecurity risk strategy: This should be based on your organization's specific cybersecurity objectives, the risk environment, and lessons learned from the past.
    
    - Establish defined risk management policies: Policies should be approved by management and should be organization-wide, repeatable, and recurring, and should align with the current cybersecurity threat environment, risks, and mission objectives.
    
    - Develop and communicate organizational cybersecurity practices: These must be straightforward and communicated regularly.
    
    - Establish and monitor cybersecurity supply chain risk management: Establish strategy, policy, and roles and responsibilities; including for overseeing suppliers, customers, and partners.
    
    - Implement continuous oversight and checkpoints: Analyze risks at regular intervals and monitor them continuously.

Identify:
	The organization's current cybersecurity risks are understood.
	
	- Asset management: Assets(data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people, etc.) are identified and managed.

	- Risk assessment: The cybersecurity risks to the organization, assets, and individuals are understood by the organization.
	
	- Improvement: Improvements to organizational cybersecurity risk management processes, procedures, and activities are identified across all CSF functions.
